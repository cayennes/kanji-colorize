# kanji_colorizer.py is part of kanji-colorize which makes KanjiVG data
# into colored stroke order diagrams; this is the anki2 addon file.

# Copyright 2012 Cayenne Boyer
#
# The code to do this automatically when the Kanji field is exited was
# originally based on the Japanese support reading generation addon by
# Damien Elmes

# Installation: copy this file and the kanjicolorizer directory to your
# Anki addons folder.

# Usage: Add a "Diagram" field to a model with "Japanese"
# in the name and a field named "Kanji".  When you finish editing the
# kanji field, if it contains precisely one character, a colored stroke
# order diagram will be added to the Diagram field in the same way that
# the Japanese support plugin adds readings.
#
# To add diagrams to all such fields, or regenerate them with new
# settings, use the "Kanji Colorizer: (re)generate all" option in the
# tools menu.

# CONFIGURATION

# Change the settings by editing the part between quotation marks in
# the last line of each block; leave everything else as it is.

# MODE
config = "--mode "
# spectrum: color progresses evenly through the spectrum; nice for
#           seeing the way the kanji is put together at a glance, but
#           has the disadvantage of using similar colors for consecutive
#           strokes which can make it less clear which number goes with
#           which number goes with which stroke.
# contrast: maximizes the contrast among any group of consecutive
#           strokes, using the golden ratio; also provides consistency
#           by using the same sequence for every kanji
config += "spectrum"

# uncomment this line to color whole groups instead of strokes
#config += " --group-mode "

# SATURATION
config += " --saturation "
# --saturation: a decimal indicating saturation where 0 is
# white/gray/black and 1 is completely colorful
config += "0.95"

# VALUE
config += " --value "
# --value: a decimal indicating value where 0 is black and 1 is colored
# or white
config += "0.75"

# IMAGE SIZE
config += " --image-size "
# --image-size: image size in pixels; they're square so this will be
# both height and width
config += "327"

# END CONFIGURATION
